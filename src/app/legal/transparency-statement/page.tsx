                  Welcome to Alliance Forge. This statement outlines key information about how
                  digital assets, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies,
                  and virtual goods, function within our game. Our goal is to provide a
                  clear understanding of these elements to ensure a transparent and fair gameplay experience.

                  Please read this statement carefully. By participating in Alliance Forge and interacting

                  <strong>Definition:</strong> NFTs are unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain,
                  used to certify ownership of a specific digital asset. In Alliance Forge,
                  NFTs may represent items such as the &quot;Founder&apos;s Ark&quot; or other unique collectibles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Acquisition:</strong> NFTs within Alliance Forge are earned through significant
                  in-game achievements, participation in special events, or specific purchases
                  where explicitly stated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Ownership & Blockchain:</strong> When you acquire an Alliance Forge NFT,
                  it is associated with your connected cryptocurrency wallet address on the [Specify Blockchain, e.g., Polygon, Ethereum] blockchain.
                  You have control over this NFT in your wallet, subject to the rules of the blockchain network.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Utility:</strong> The utility of NFTs within Alliance Forge will be described
                  at the point of acquisition or in official game documentation. Utility may include
                  in-game benefits, cosmetic enhancements, or access to exclusive content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Trading & Value:</strong> You are free to trade, sell, or transfer your NFTs on third-party marketplaces
                  that support the relevant blockchain and NFT standard. Alliance Forge does not operate these marketplaces
                  and is not responsible for transactions conducted on them. The value of NFTs is determined by the market and community.

                  <strong>Auron (Premium In-Game Currency):</strong> Auron is an in-game virtual currency
                  used to purchase premium items, boosts, or cosmetic content in Alliance Forge.
                  Auron is primarily acquired by connecting a crypto wallet or through direct purchases.
                  Auron is an internal virtual currency and is NOT a cryptocurrency. It exists only within the game&apos;s ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Points (Standard In-Game Currency):</strong> Points are the primary currency earned
                  through gameplay (e.g., tapping, completing quests). They are used for standard upgrades and progression.
                  Points are a virtual good with utility only inside the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Future Cryptocurrency Token:</strong> Alliance Forge plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency token in the future.
                  Details about such a token, including its utility, economics (tokenomics), and distribution (e.g., airdrop mechanics based on &quot;Founder&apos;s Score&quot;),
                  will be provided in a separate whitepaper or official announcement. Treat any claims of an existing Alliance Forge token outside of official announcements with extreme caution.
